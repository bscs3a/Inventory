Step 1:
Close the accounts(do not close if 0)  
> Get the accounts that was closed in the retained earnings for that month(only consider revenue and expenses) 
Create income statement depending on month (check the retained earnings ledger code)
> Calculate Sales - Expense

Step 2:
Check if the current retained earnings is 0 - that means it is closed
> else
Close the retained earnings/loss by dividing it to the owners (liabilities and owner's equity)
> Display the owner's equity with the divided retained earnings
